Medium difficulty
6-8 servings
30 min prep + 2 hours cooking time

Requires 1 large pot, and one skillet that can handle high heat (=cast iron or carbon steel; no teflon or ceramics, or you will ruin it and your health!)

## Ingredients

* 1 large carrot + 1 additional carrot for later
* 2 onions
* 2-3 stalks of celery
* 1 leek

* a dozen or more button mushrooms

* 800 grams of boneless chicken 

* chicken stock for 1.5L liquid
* 1L water
* 250 white cooking wine
* a splash of cream

* bay leaves
* fresh thyme
* salt
* pepper

* potatoes

## Instructions

* Slice the vegetables and put in a large pot with a small amount of some cooking grease
* Put the pot on medium heat and gently brown the vegetables. You should see a gentle column of steam rising from the vegetables (and smell something delicious)
* Quart the mushrooms and put in a skillet, sear on high heat to get rid of the water in them
* Put the mushrooms with the vegetables

* Cut and the chicken into mouth-sized pieces and quickly brown at medium-high heat, salt and pepper as you go
* Put the chicken with the vegetables

* Add wine, water, chicken stock to the pot
* Add a few bay leaves
* Make a bouquet garni with the thyme and a carrot (i.e. tie the thyme to a carrot with some cooking twine) -- or just toss it in there if you haven't got the twine or patience.
* Bring to a simmer and let it simmer for as long as you have patience, at least 30 minutes but ideally 2+ hours.

* 20 minutes before serving, peel and cut potatoes and add to the soup. 
* Add a splash of cream
* Taste and add more salt if necessary
* Fish out the bouquet
* Serve

Tastes even better the next day!
