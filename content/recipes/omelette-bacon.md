## Ingredients

* 7-8 strips of bacon
* 6 eggs
* Cream
* Chives
* Cheese (grated or to grate)
* Black pepper

## Instructions

* Cook bacon in a large skillet until crispy
* Take out bacon and leave to dry a bit on a paper towel
* Turn off the heat and *leave the bacon grease in skillet!*

* Crack the eggs in a bowl
* Add a splash of cream to the eggs
* Add some black pepper
* Chop the bacon into smaller bits
* Put the bacon in the batter
* Whisk

* Pour the batter into the skillet
* Grate some cheese on top of it
* Set it on low-medium heat, add a lid if you've got one that fits
* Wait until it sets
* Let it cool for a bit!
* Cut a generous amount of chives sprinkle on top of it

If you are too impatient to let the omelette cool, putting chives on a piping hot omelette will cook them and then they lose all flavor.

* Fold the omelette on top of itself and cut into portion sizes
* Eat it while it's hot!
