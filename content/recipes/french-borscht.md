I realize this may offend frenchmen and eastern europeans alike. That's fine, because it turned out alright. There can be peace.

Note that this is more of a sketch than an actual recipe. You will need to make flavor adjustments.

Simplicity: Intermediate
Meal: Dinner
Cooking time: 2+ hours
Health: It healthy for the soul
Servings: 6-8

Make sure you have 1 small pot, 1 large pot, and a frying pan available.

## Ingredients

### Mirepoix
* 1 large onion (chopped)
* 2 stalks of celery (chopped)
* 2 carrots (chopped)
* 1-2 tbsp tomato puree

### Stew base
* 1 glass of red wine, cooking wine is fine
* 2 vegetable bouillon cubes
* Water (1L / 4 cups)
* 1 bay leaf
* Fresh thyme (or dried, whatever)

### Mushrooms

* Button mushrooms (sliced)

### Root Vegetables
* 6 red beats cut into smaller pieces, or sliced
* 1 parsnip, sliced
* 1 parsley root, sliced (can also just use another parsnip)

### Meat
* Meat appropriate for a stew (400g, cut into mouth-pieces)
* Bacon, cubed (about 200g)

### Finisher

* Creme fraiche
* Balsamic vinegar
* Salt

## Instructions

* Pre-boil the beats in a separate pot

* Gently brown the mirepoix vegetables in a stock pot
* Add tomato puree and stir around
* When you start getting a brown residue at the bottom of the pot, add the stew base
* Bring to a slow boil

* Add root vegetables
* Sear the mushrooms at high heat to get rid of the liquid in them, then add to the stew
* Brown the meat in a skillet, salt and pepper, then add to the stew

* Let cook for as long as you have patience, but at least 60-90 minutes
* Top off with some more water if necessary
* It's done when the beats start getting soft and the meat is falling apart

* Add some creme fraiche

* Give it a taste, if it tastes overly sweet, add some balsamic vinegar
* If it tastes off or bland, add salt
