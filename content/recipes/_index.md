Welcome to the Marginalia institute for chefs who can't cook good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too!

Cooking is almost entirely about balancing sour with sweet and adding enough salt. Figure out when you've got too much of one and not enough of another, and you can make virtually anything tasty. If you aren't tasting your food
as it's cooking, you're doing it wrong.
