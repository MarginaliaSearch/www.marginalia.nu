Upgrading to <a href="/release-notes/v2023-08-0" rel="nofollow">2023.08.0</a> and loading a
new batch of crawl data. This should take about a day.

Update 2023-08-23: This is taking a bit longer than expected. The outage will definitely last
a few days.  A problem arose due to the more relaxed language detection logic allowed more keywords
in the lexicon than would fit in RAM.  Rolling back the change is easy, but requires reprocessing
all of the data before it can be loaded.
