Upgrading to <a href="/release-notes/v2023-08-0" rel="nofollow">2023.08.0</a> and loading a new batch of crawl data. This should take about a day.

Update 2023-08-23: This is taking a bit longer than expected. The outage will definitely last a few days.  A problem arose due to the more relaxed language detection logic allowed more keywords in the lexicon than would fit in RAM.  Rolling back the change is easy, but requires reprocessing all of the data before it can be loaded.

Update 2023-08-25: This is a deeply cursed release cycle.  The loading made it 97% through before running out of memory.  A new attempt is under way.  No need to re-process, just reduced how many websites it will attempt to load a bit.
