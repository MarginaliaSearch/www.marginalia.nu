I'm just one guy building all of this on my own. I'd like to expand the search engine and make it more useful.  My hope is that it will bring value to its users and enable a thriving independent Internet. 

The search engine doesn't have any secret sauce, all the [source code is publicly available](https://git.marginalia.nu/) and as far as is legally and logistically possible, the [data](https://downloads.marginalia.nu/) is also available. 

The entire work is funded by my own savings, supplemented by grants and public donations.  To this end I have a few donation links. Every last bit helps and even a modest contribution is greatly appreciated and will lengthen the time I'm able to work like this.

* [github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/MarginaliaSearch)

You can also just send me an email at kontakt@marginalia.nu and we can discuss other alternatives.  

Note: I am reluctant to receive smaller cryptocurrency donations due to the extremely crypto-hostile banking landscape of Sweden. 

## Other

The cheapest way you can support the search engine is by using it, and talking about it, and telling me when things go wrong. Feedback is invaluable, even if it's just "this-and-that query gives bad results", as I often use exactly such bad queries to figure out how to improve the results. I also just like getting emails. Lots of people have reached out and it's very inspiring.
