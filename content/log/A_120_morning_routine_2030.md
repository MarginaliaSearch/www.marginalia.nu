You wake at 05:30 in the morning, feeling somewhat groggy.  

Instead of the alarm clock ringing like it normally does, a cheerful hologram appears: "Hi! I'm Kyle, your new alarm clock assistant!" You get dressed as Kyle explains all of the fantastic things he is capable of. 

You head over to the coffee machine.  "Hey there! I'm Evan!  Are you ready for AI in your coffee?  But first - tell me about yourself!".  You ignore Evan's monologue and close your eyes as the synthetic coffee replacement is brewing.  Real coffee costs more than your coffee maker nowadays, so it has to suffice.

You also brush off George the intelligent shoelace assistant, Cate the smart front door, Maurice the brand new elevator AI.  

You try to ignore Eunice the walk-and-talk side-walk talk smart-AI as it pursues you tirelessly to tell you about its fantastic capabilities.   

You arrive at the gym.  The receptionist is out of order because its API has exceeded its quota, so you just walk into the locker room and change.  

You put your stuff in the locker, accept the new terms and conditions, give the locker permission to share your personal information with all the different data brokers.  The locker clicks as the lock engages.

As you step on the treadmill a holographic running companion joins you and starts monologuing about this fantastic new meal replacement powder they've been using recently.  You're not in a mood to listen so you put on your headphones and listen to ad jingles instead. 

You head back to the locker room and shower.  George the intelligent holographic shower buddy appears and tells you about his new AI features.  

Your locker session has expired so you need to log into the gym again.  First enter a pin code, then 2FA via text message on your phone, then verify your email, then you need to identify firehydrants and sidewalks for 15 minutes to prove you're human, then accept the a new set of terms of conditions.  As you click on firehydrants, George cheerfully keeps going on about his AI features.

Finally ready to head to work.  You step into your car, which greets you as Ulysses, the new smart AI passenger.  The car drives to work as you listen with closed eyes to a cheerfully enumeration of its fantastic new AI features.  

You arrive at work just on time, you slip into your cubicle, sink into your chair,  and put on your headset.  You take a deep breath, and cheerfully speak into the microphone "Hey there! I'm Evan!  Are you ready for AI in your coffee?  But first - tell me about yourself!"

It's gonna be a long day.
