title: 'Less Coffee, Better Sleep'

As an experiment, I've reduced my coffee-intake to a single cup a day for about a week now.  It's made an enormous difference in sleep, mood and energy.  I get tired at night, fall asleep quickly, and wake up refreshed.

As mentioned previously in the context of [morning sunlight exposure](/log/86-sleep/)---another thing that's aided my sleeping habits, but is somewhat less practical to sustain as it requires fair weather---I've always been slow to get going in the morning, active at night, bad at getting to bed at sane hours.  Tired when I should be awake, and awake when I should be tired.  

Normally I'd drink 4, sometimes 5 large cups of coffee throughout the day (I say cups but it's literal tea mugs), and it wasn't until the third I really could get going.  Didn't feel jittery or anything like that, mostly different shades of tired.

Tired of feeling tired, I decided to see what reducing caffeine would do.  I'd experimented with similar things years before, with success, but not stuck with it.

For the experiment, I started by taking a day completely off coffee.  

Caffeine has a surprisingly long half-life in the body, between 3-6 hours, enough so that with my previous intake, I'd plausibly wake up with up to a cup of coffee still in my blood from the previous day, so I figured this might help reset the levels a bit to kick off the experiment wit a clean slate.  

The day with no coffee I felt more tired than I think I've ever felt in my life.  I napped through the day, headaches, lethargy, was generally just out of it.  I fell asleep much earlier than normal and slept for nine and a half hours.  What I felt was how exhausted I actually was, without having enough caffeine in my blood to put down a horse masking the tiredness.

Next day, and going forward, I started my day with a single cup (fine, mug) of coffee.  Following this, no caffeine all day, no tea, no chocolate, no soda, nothing. 

What's happened since is I wake up well rested.  Usually after 7-8 hours of solid sleep.  I'd get this number of hours before as well, mixed with 5-6 hour nights, and even though this isn't necessarily longer than I'd get before, I feel significantly more refreshed.  

All day my head is clear and my mood is stable, and there's a general sense of effortless lightness to everything that's hard to put in words.

At night, I get tired, way more tired than I usually do.  Sometimes I've had a slight indication of a headache, but mostly tired.  Old-man-falls-asleep-in-front-of-the-TV tired.  So I go to bed.  Fall asleep instantly.  Rinse and repeat.

Huh.  Can not drinking nearly two liters of coffee every day improve your sleep quality?  Big if true.
