I'm happy and grateful to announce that the Marginalia Search 
project has been accepted for a second [nlnet](https://nlnet.nl/) grant.

All the details are not yet finalized, but tentatively the grant will go toward addressing most of the items in the project 
[backlog for 2025](https://github.com/MarginaliaSearch/MarginaliaSearch/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

I've already been working full time on the project since [summer 2023](/log/83_full_time/), and this grant secures additional development time, and extends the runway to a comfortable degree.

Will post more details as they are finalized.
