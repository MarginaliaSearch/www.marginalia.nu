I killed the old memex.marginalia.nu site. Not because it wasn't great,
but because I don't have the time to maintain the software, which was quite janky, 
and perhaps most of all I wasn't really feeling it. 

The new site looks superficially similar, but it's actually just a Hugo
template that emulates some of the memex' capabilities. Although some of
the coolest stuff is sadly gone as a result.

Thankfully I decided to use an extremely portable markup format when building
the original memex software, which meant that porting it over to hugo was literally
just a matter of writing a brief python script.

Initially the plan was to use an existing template, to save myself a lot of effort,
but it turns out the ones that looked good were kinda shit, and the ones that weren't
shit were too bloated.
