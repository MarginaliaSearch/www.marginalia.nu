Want a dumb phone but live somewhere that requires
a smartphone app to park your car or pay your bills,
or have friends that are only reachable via Messenger
or some other app?

Googles hate this one weird trick:

Simply uninstall all irrelevant apps and disable everything 
that can't be uninstalled, *including* chrome.  This can be
done by long pressing the icons in the launcher menu,
and going to app info.

Next go into the settings and disable any features you
don't want.  If done indiscriminately enough, you'll have 
a phone with zero distractions, and likely a week-long 
battery life.
